<h1>What Is FIRE?</h1>
<p>FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. The goal is to build enough investable assets that a safe withdrawal rate can cover your spending.</p>
<h2>How people estimate FIRE</h2>
<p>Many use a withdrawal rate assumption (for example, 4â€“6%). Annual spending divided by the withdrawal rate gives a rough target portfolio size.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Know your monthly spending</li>
  <li>Increase savings rate over time</li>
  <li>Invest consistently in low-cost diversified funds</li>
</ul>
