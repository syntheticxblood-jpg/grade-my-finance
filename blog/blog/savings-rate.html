<h1>Savings Rate Benchmarks by Age</h1>
<p>There’s no perfect number, but simple targets help. Here’s a common range for total savings (retirement + brokerage + HSA):</p>
<ul>
  <li>20s: 10–20% if you can swing it</li>
  <li>30s: 15–25%</li>
  <li>40s: 20–30%</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren’t rules; they’re reference points. If you’re paying down high-interest debt or supporting family, rates can vary.</p>
