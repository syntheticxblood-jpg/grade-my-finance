  <h1>What Is a Good Savings Rate?</h1>
  <p>Your savings rate is the percentage of your after-tax income that you set aside for the future. For example, if you earn $5,000 per month and save $1,000, your savings rate is 20%.</p>

  <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>10% or less:</strong> Minimum, often not enough for early retirement.</li>
    <li><strong>15–20%:</strong> Solid, puts you on track for a comfortable retirement at normal age.</li>
    <li><strong>25–50%:</strong> Aggressive, often tied to FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) goals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Increase Your Savings Rate</h2>
  <p>Try cutting recurring expenses, automating savings, and increasing income through side hustles or career growth.</p>
