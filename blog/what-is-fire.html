  <h1>What Is FIRE?</h1>
  <p>FIRE stands for <strong>Financial Independence, Retire Early</strong>. It’s a movement where people save and invest aggressively so they can retire years, or even decades, before the traditional retirement age.</p>

  <h2>The Core Principles of FIRE</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain a high savings rate, often 40% or more.</li>
    <li>Invest in low-cost index funds or other growth assets.</li>
    <li>Keep expenses low to reach independence faster.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why People Pursue FIRE</h2>
  <p>The main appeal is freedom — the ability to live life on your own terms, work only if you want to, and spend time on what matters most.</p>

  <h2>How to Know If You’re on Track</h2>
  <p>Most FIRE enthusiasts use a “safe withdrawal rate” (often 4%) to estimate how much they need to retire. For example, if your annual expenses are $40,000, you’d aim for about $1,000,000 saved.</p>
