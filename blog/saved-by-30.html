<h1>How Much Should You Have Saved by 30?</h1>
<p>A common rule of thumb says having around one year of salary saved by age 30 is a solid target. It’s only a rule of thumb; real life varies by income, cost of living, and goals.</p>
<h2>Why this benchmark exists</h2>
<p>Early savings benefit most from compounding. Hitting 1× income by 30 reduces the pressure later, especially if you increase contributions each year.</p>
<h2>What actually matters</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Your savings rate versus your income</li>
  <li>High-interest debt paid down</li>
  <li>Emergency fund of at least a few months</li>
</ul>
