    <h1>How to Check Your Financial Health in 5 Minutes</h1>
    <p><em>By Grady the Owl 🦉</em></p>

    <p>Ever wondered if your money is in good shape? With a quick check, you can spot where you stand financially without spending hours digging through spreadsheets.</p>

    <h2>1. Look at Your Net Worth</h2>
    <p>Add up your assets (cash, savings, investments, home) and subtract your debts (credit cards, student loans, car). That’s your net worth.</p>

    <h2>2. Check Your Savings Rate</h2>
    <p>Are you saving at least 15% of your income? If not, Grady says: 🟥 Danger zone!</p>

    <h2>3. Grade Yourself</h2>
    <p>Instead of guessing, plug your numbers into <a href="../index.html">Grade My Finance</a> and get your free report card in seconds.</p>
